Topic: Creating A Simple Command Line Operating System

Description:
Challenges:
    Sunday, April 05, 2020: Previously, I had my code for receiving user commands and checking if they were valid commands in 
    main.cpp. This was done to make sure the base of the program was running properly. Today, I separated this code between 
    main.cpp and marcamOS.cpp. I am able to compile both files, but am encountering a "duplicate symbol" error when linking 
    them. I realized this was due to a simple mistake in my '#include' statements.

    Friday, April 10, 2020: I am implementing the 'writeToFile' function today and am having trouble with pipe redirection. I am
    trying to write from standard input to the file, but can't seem to get it working properly.
